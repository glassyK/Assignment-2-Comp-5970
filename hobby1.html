<h1>Music</h1>
<p>Music has been a part of my life for most of my life. I started piano lessons when I was around 8 years old at the will of my parents.
    At first I enjoyed it... then I began to hate it as it got more competitive and I had to do more concerts and compititions.
    Eventually my parents let me wuit doing
